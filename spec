# Math Quest

Here's a focused, actionable Markdown specification for a **4th-grade math game** that balances pedagogy and fun:

```markdown
# Math Mastermind: 4th Grade Showdown  
**Core Objective**: Master multiplication/division facts (0-12) through fast-paced challenges.

## 1. Gameplay Mechanics  
### **Power-Up Progression System**  
- **Rocket Fuel**: Correct answers fill a progress bar that unlocks:  
  - **Speed Boost**: 2x points for 10 seconds  
  - **Shield**: Skip 1 wrong answer penalty  
  - **Rainbow Blast**: Auto-solve next 3 problems  
- **Combo Multiplier**: +0.1x multiplier for each consecutive correct answer (max 3x)

### **Dynamic Problem Generation**  
- **Smart Difficulty**:  
```

if score > 100: add 2-digit multipliers (e.g., 15×4)
if accuracy > 90%: introduce division facts

```
- **Themed Challenges**:  
- "Pirate Treasure": Solve to unlock map pieces  
- "Robot Factory": Fix broken equations to build bots

## 2. Engagement Features  
### **Visual Design**  
- **Character Customization**: Unlock hats/outfits with math mastery  
- **Interactive Animations**:  
- Numbers explode into confetti on correct answers  
- Wrong answers trigger humorous "glitch" effects

### **Reward System**  
- **Daily Streaks**: Bonus coins for 3+ consecutive days  
- **Achievement Badges**:  
- "Lightning Calculator" (solve 10 in <15s)  
- "Perfect Run" (100% accuracy in 20-problem set)

## 3. Technical Specs  
### **Performance Optimization**  
- **Mobile-First Design**:  
- 300ms touch response time  
- Sub-500KB asset loading  
- **Offline Support**: Local cache for progress tracking

### **Pedagogical Safeguards**  
- **Mistake Analysis**:  
```

function showSolution() {
displayStepByStepAnimation("12×3 = (10×3) + (2×3)");
}

```
- **Confidence Check**: After errors, repeat similar problem type

## 4. Code-Ready Components  
### **Core Game Loop**  
```

function gameLoop() {
problem = generateProblem();
startTimer();
playerAnswer = getInput();

if (validateAnswer(problem, playerAnswer)) {
addToScore(calculatePoints(timeLeft));
triggerPowerUp();
} else {
showSolution();
adjustDifficulty(-1);
}

updateProgressBar();
}

```

### **Multi-Device Controls**  
- **Touch**: Swipe left=skip, right=submit  
- **Keyboard**: Number pad entry with sound feedback

## 5. Next-Level Features (Post-MVP)  
- **Classroom Mode**: Teacher dashboard for progress tracking  
- **AR Integration**: Scan real-world objects to generate problems  
- **Voice Challenges**: "Alexa, ask Math Mastermind for a speed round"

---

**Why This Works**:  
1. **Brain Science**: Immediate feedback + variable rewards = dopamine-driven learning  
2. **Curriculum Alignment**: Focused on 4th grade fluency standards (3.OA.C.7)  
3. **Replay Factor**: Daily streaks + cosmetic unlocks = long-term engagement
```

This spec prioritizes **multiplication/division mastery** (critical 4th grade focus) while embedding multiple engagement layers. The code snippets are LLM-ready for direct implementation, and the mobile optimizations ensure smooth performance on school-issued devices. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific component?
